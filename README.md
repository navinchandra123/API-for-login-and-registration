# Login, Registration with Authentication using HTML | CSS | BOOTSTRAP | NODEJS | MONGODB | EJS

I have created a web application that conatins a logn and a registartion page. This application is fully 
Authenticated. In registration page we take some input from user like Name , Email , Contact Number , Date Of Birth ,
Password and Comfirm Password. If all the data is correct then we insert ther user data in our database(MONGODB).

And in Login page we ask for email and password of user and if email and password both are correct then we redirect the user to 
the dashboard.On dashboard we have a logout button and if user clicked on logout button the he will be logged out.

For the better understanding, I am uploading some screenshots of my application.
